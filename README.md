## Description

**Choice of assignment: Option A - BC Liquor app.**\
Added new features:
* Feature 1: add a logo image - this will make the user interface look more appealing.
* Feature 2: add color parameter to the plot - this could enable the user to decide on the colour of the bars in the plot, which is more flexible and could be used to differentiate different plots.
* Feature 3: place plot and table in separate tabs - this way the user can switch between different figures, also the layout of the webpage will be more organized and concise. 
* Feature 4: show the number of results found whenever the filters change - this will give the user a direct numeric reflection of the number of results returned based on the filters chosen.
